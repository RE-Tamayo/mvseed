# MVSeed Framework

MVSeed Framework is a lightweight and flexible MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework for PHP. It provides a robust foundation for building web applications with ease and efficiency. With MVSeed, you can develop scalable and maintainable PHP applications while following best practices and adhering to the MVC architectural pattern.

## Features

- **Routing**: Easily define clean and user-friendly URLs, map them to controller actions, and handle HTTP requests effortlessly.
- **Database Abstraction**: Simplify database operations with the built-in database abstraction layer. Connect to databases, execute queries, and manage results seamlessly.
- **Templating**: Create dynamic and reusable templates using the powerful templating engine. Separate your presentation logic from business logic effortlessly.

## Installation

To install MVSeed Framework, follow these steps:

1. Use Composer to create a new project based on the MVSeed Framework:
   ```shell
   composer create-project retamayo/mvseed your-project-name
   ```
This command will create a new directory named your-project-name and install the MVSeed Framework and its dependencies inside it. Replace your-project-name with the desired name for your project.

2. Create a configuration file (e.g., .env) on the document root and customize it based on your application's needs (Note: Use the .env-example as a basis).

3. Start building your application by defining routes, controllers, and views in the appropriate directories.
